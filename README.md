# Algorithms

This **Algorithms project** is a collection of the excersices we were practicing on the Colt Steele's Udemy course
[_"JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass"_](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass), which I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in Algorithm studying â€” Colt is a wonderful teacher, one of my favorite ever!
